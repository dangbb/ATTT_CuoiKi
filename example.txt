Every five years when Indians cast their vote in parliamentary elections, the world watches with admiration as the world's largest democracy charts its future path because the outcome of decisions made by one billion people resonates around the globe, der Leyen said at the beginning of her address."As vibrant democracies, India and the EU share fundamental values and common interests. Together, we believe in each country's right to determine its own destiny; we believe in rule of law and fundamental rights; we believe that it is democracy that best delivers for citizens," she added.The European Commission president also pointed out that democracy was born in Europe more than two thousand years ago, but today India is its largest home.Both our economies thrive in the world of common rules and fair competition. And we share the same interests in safe trading routes, seamless supply chains and in a free and open Indo-Pacific, she said.On the ongoing war in Ukraine, she said that Europe will make sure that unprovoked-unjustified aggression against Kyiv will be a strategic failure and that Europe is doing all it can to help the war-ravaged country fight for its freedom."In Europe, we see Russia's aggression as a direct threat to our security," she said and highlighted that effective sanctions were imposed on Russia.
